SWAP DISCUSSION

I have a new block chain called XYZ. It is a fork of the Monero blockchain. I want to chain swap the XYZ blockchain to another chain which is also a fork of Monero. What are the basics for setting up the swap?

Swapping your Monero-forked blockchain, XYZ, to another Monero-forked chain requires a specific process, since private coins like Monero don't use the standard token-swapping methods of public blockchains like Ethereum. This type of conversion is a "mainnet swap" and is typically managed by the developers of the chains involved. 
The core concept is that you will send your old coins (XYZ) to a designated address and then receive the new coins on the other chain's network. This can be facilitated by a centralized process run by the development teams or, more securely, through an atomic swap protocol. 

Here are the basic steps for setting up a chain swap:

STEP 1: Establish developer coordination
Since both chains are Monero forks, the developers must coordinate the swap. They will need to agree on:

    A swap ratio: The rate at which XYZ coins will be exchanged for the new coins.
    The total supply: The plan for the supply of the new coin. For example, will the total supply be the sum of all XYZ coins swapped?
    A swap deadline: An official timeframe for users to complete the swap.
    An audit: An independent review of the swap process to ensure transparency and security. 

STEP 2: Set up the swap mechanism 

There are two primary methods for this type of swap:
Method A: Centralized and time-limited 
This is a simpler, but less trustless, approach. 

    Define the lock-in: The developers publish a start and end block height for the swap. During this time, users must send their XYZ coins to a specified "burn" or holding address.
    Create a claims portal: A portal is developed to allow users to register their XYZ wallet address and the address on the new chain where they want to receive the new coins.
    Execute the token issuance: After the deadline, the developers tally the total number of XYZ coins sent to the burn address and issue the new coins to the registered wallet addresses on the new blockchain. 

Method B: Atomic swaps
This approach is decentralized and is the more secure, trustless method preferred for Monero-style swaps. 

    Utilize an atomic swap protocol: Implement a cross-chain atomic swap protocol, such as the one described in the research paper developed for Bitcoin and Monero. This relies on cryptographic techniques to ensure the swap happens without a third party.
    Generate a swap address: A specific address is generated for each swap transaction.
    Lock the funds: Each participant sends their coins to the unique address, locking them in place.
    Mutually exclusive claim: The protocol is designed so that claiming funds on one chain is mutually exclusive from claiming funds on the other. This means that if one party fails to complete their side of the trade, the other party can recover their locked funds. 

STEP 3: Implement client-side wallet updates
To support the swap, the wallet software for both blockchains will need to be updated. 

    Wallet message: The XYZ wallet must display a warning to all users that the swap is in progress and prompt them to upgrade their wallet to the new chain's software.
    New wallet support: The developers must release new wallet clients for the new blockchain that support the swap process.

STEP 4: Develop a community communication plan
A clear communication strategy is crucial to ensure a smooth transition and prevent user confusion or lost funds.

    Public announcements: Announce the swap and its details on all official channels, such as social media, websites, and community forums.
    User guides: Create detailed, step-by-step guides for users on how to swap their coins.
    Support team: Set up a temporary support team to assist users who encounter issues during the swap. 

STEP 5: Execute the swap and monitor 
After the pre-swap steps are complete, the developers must launch the swap process and closely monitor it.

    Activation: The swap is activated at the predetermined block height.
    Monitoring: The developers should monitor the process for any issues, such as transactions failing or users having difficulty with the process.
    Finalization: After the swap deadline, a snapshot of all swap transactions is taken, and the new coins are distributed.
